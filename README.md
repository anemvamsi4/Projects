Welcome to my machine learning, deep learning, and NLP projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on using various ML and DL techniques, as well as natural language processing tools.

Some of the projects included in this repository are:

- Sentiment analysis of twitter comments/tweets
- A deployable model to auto-delete negative comments from social media platforms using sentiment analysis (all languages - using language translation)
- Weather Condition Prediction using machine learning algorithms (Deployable model)
- Image classification using convolutional neural networks
- Deployable Language Translation webpage using google translate library

Each project comes with its own set of instructions, data sets, and source files to help you understand how it works and how it can be adapted for your own needs. 

Feel free to explore the repository, and don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback. Let's learn together!
