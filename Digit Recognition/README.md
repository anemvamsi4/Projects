This is a Kaggle Competition project in which the images of numerical digits has to be classified into 10 Classes.
I have included the dataset in the 'digit-recognizer.zip' file. Exract the zip file to get data.
The approch to the project is in 'Digit_recog_ML.ipynb' file.
In this I have gone with two models:
  1. Random Forest Classifier - Accuracy = 95.95
  2. CNN model - Accuracy = 98.94

Accuracy on Kaggle test data is 98.989
