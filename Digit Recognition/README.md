# Digit Recognition
Author: Krishna Vamsi

This GitHub directory contains a digit recognition model that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) for accurate classification of handwritten digits. The project is implemented in Python using the Keras library.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the MNIST dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. I have included the dataset in the 'digit-recognizer.zip' file.

The project includes the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The model architecture is based on CNN and includes layers such as convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

The repository also includes a pre-trained model that can be used for prediction on new data.

The model achieved an accuracy of  99% on the testing dataset, demonstrating its high performance in recognizing handwritten digits. The project serves as a great starting point for those interested in image recognition and classification using deep learning techniques.

This project is a great example of how CNN can be used for image classification tasks and can serve as a starting point for anyone interested in building similar models.

I have also included a traditional machine learning approach using Random Forest Classifier for this with 95% accuracy.
