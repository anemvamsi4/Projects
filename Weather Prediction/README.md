# Weather Condition Prediction using ML

This directory contains a machine learning project focused on weather condition prediction using a Random Forest Classifier. The goal of this project is to predict weather conditions based on a set of input features, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

The dataset used for this project is included in the directory, and it has to be preprocessed and cleaned. Unwanted features have been removed, null values have been handled appropriately in our project, and the data has been normalized to ensure reliable predictions. The clean dataset is used to train the Random Forest Classifier model.

The Python notebook included in the directory provides a step-by-step guide on the implementation of the project. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis. The notebook also demonstrates the use of the Gradio library to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the trained model. This allows users to input weather parameters and obtain predicted weather conditions based on the trained model.

Additionally, the trained Random Forest Classifier model is saved as a pickle file and included in the repository. This allows for easy access and usage of the model for weather condition prediction without the need to retrain it each time.

By exploring python notebook in this directory, developers and data scientists can gain insights into building a weather condition prediction model using machine learning techniques. The preprocessing techniques showcased in the project ensure data quality, while the Random Forest Classifier provides accurate predictions based on the input features.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of applying machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest Classifier, to predict weather conditions. The inclusion of the dataset, model, and notebook in the directory enables easy replication, experimentation, and further development.

This weather condition prediction model can have various practical applications, such as aiding in agricultural planning, supporting transportation systems, and assisting in weather forecasting. It provides a solid foundation for building more sophisticated and accurate weather prediction systems.
